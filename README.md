# Garuda - Real-Time Surveillance System

## Description of the Hack
Garuda enhances urban public safety through a real-time surveillance web application that automatically detects criminal activities using surveillance camera feeds. The system analyzes live video streams, identifies suspicious behaviors, and notifies users and authorities about potential threats. This initiative aims to reduce the reliance on continuous human surveillance and increase the efficiency of crime detection and prevention.

## Tech Stack Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow, OpenCV for real-time video processing and crime detection
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum for criminal profiling logs
- **APIs**: Google Maps API for geolocation features

## Installation Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/garuda.git
   cd garuda
   ```
2. **Install Backend Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```
3. **Install Frontend Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```
4. **Set up Environment Variables**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add database credentials and API keys as follows:
     ```
     DATABASE_URL="your_database_url"
     API_KEY="your_api_key"
     ```
5. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Libraries and Dependencies Required
- **Node.js and npm** (Node package manager)
- **React.js** libraries: Axios, Redux for state management
- **Express.js** as the server framework
- **TensorFlow** and **Keras** for AI models
- **Flask** 

## Declaration of Previous/Adapted Work
This project is an adaptation and continuation of previous work conducted in the domain of public safety surveillance. Previous implementations focused primarily on manual monitoring and lacked real-time processing capabilities. The last 28 hours have been dedicated to integrating real-time crime detection technology and blockchain for secure criminal profiling.
